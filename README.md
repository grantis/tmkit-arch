# Terminal Kit - Friendly Linux From Scratch

A minimal, beginner-friendly terminal setup that works on any fresh Linux install.
Tested on Ubuntu Server, Arch, and Debian. One script, two config files, done.

---

## What You Get

- A beautiful, informative prompt (Starship)
- Friendly help system built into the shell (`helpme`, `tips`, `cheat`)
- Safer file handling (trash instead of delete)
- Git shortcuts
- Smart command-not-found handler (tells you what to install)
- A random tip every time you open a terminal

---
